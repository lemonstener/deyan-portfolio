# Portfolio

## Introduction
This is a light-weight portfolio website built with just HTML, CSS, and a little JavaScript. 

## Goals
To display my skills and experience in a concise manner, without any distractions such as needless animations that don't do anything for the end-user. In addition, I have made sure to pay a lot of attention to mobile-responsiviness and accessibility.

## WCAG2.0 score
